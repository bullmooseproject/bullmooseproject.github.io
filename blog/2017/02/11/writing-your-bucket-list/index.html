<div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p>When deciding to take control of your life, you have to figure out exactly what that means. Yeah sure, you want to do more that is interesting to you. But what do you actually want to do? That’s generally harder than you expect. This is where a bucket list comes in handy. To begin steering your life in the direction you want, you first must figure out what you want to do. Your bucket list will serve as a beacon through your journey. Here, I present a short guide on how to write a bucket list fit for you.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Write down What You Want to Do</h2>

<p>You should first figure out what you want most out of life. The important thing to remember here is to not “should” all over yourself. This is your life. Others will try to tell you how to live and what you “should” do to live a happy and secure life. However, this rarely lines up with what you want to do. But you feel you should do it. Fight the urge and don’t do it. What makes someone else happy won’t always make you happy. And just following their advice when it doesn&rsquo;t makes you happy will just waste precious time. This is the time to figure out what you want out of your life and you need to be honest with yourself. That’s the most important thing to remember.</p>

<p>When it comes to adding items, size or difficulty does not matter. However, if you can check off every item in the next year, you probably aren’t thinking big enough. Same with adding only major items. If you can’t accomplish anything then there really isn’t a point to having a bucket list other than to fuel your day dreams. It’s good to have a mix of both.</p>

<p>I’ll use mine as an example. I really enjoy hunting and the feeling of being able to provide for my family. My mom has always wanted a Christmas goose since watching “A Christmas Carol” as a kid. I’ve been wanting to get into waterfowl hunting so I put “providing a Christmas goose” onto my bucket list. This is pretty low hanging fruit and can be accomplished quickly. But I have “building a table and a set of chairs” on my list. This is a big task since I have no woodworking skills. But that just means I need to learn some new skills which may take a while. In the end I will be better off than when I started. Hopefully your bucket list will help you become the man you want to be rather than just a set of things to do.</p>

<h2>Adding Reach Items</h2>

<p>Some will suggest that you only add items that you can reasonably accomplish in your lifetime. That is true to some extent. But I argue that you should still add something even if you think you may not be able to accomplish it. You should still strive to complete items even if they are a reach.</p>

<p>For example, one of my items is to backpack across South America. I would like to start a family soon, so by the time I’m in shape, have the proper gear, and have enough money I will probably have kids. But does this mean I should just give up on it? Absolutely not! It will just be postponed until a different part of my life. It’s items like these that you should add. You are playing the long game here. You’re life will always be changing and you should keep that in mind when making your like.</p>

<h2>Make A Plan</h2>

<p>Generating a plan is key to checking items off of your bucket list. I don’t mean that you have to set specific dates, but you should start assembling the building blocks. For example, if you’ve always wanted to go to Europe, you can start by opening a travel rewards credit card. The everyday purchases you were making can now help you with crossing off an item on your bucket list.</p>

<p>For my South American backpacking trip, I would first need to get into backpacking shape and learn all of the skills necessary for backpacking. I’ve already found some workout programs (which I will review) and a group of friends who are willing to teach me what I need to know. In order to check items off, it’s very important that you actually make a plan. Otherwise time will just float by and nothing will get done.</p>

<h2>Remind Yourself</h2>

<p>It’s easy to to make a list and then forget about it. Instead, you need to figure out a way to have it at the forefront of your mind. One way is to enter it into a pocket notebook if you use one. Every time you take it out to make an entry you will see you bucket list and actively think about it. You can also print a list out and post it somewhere that you’ll see it frequently. I have mine printed out and posted above my computer, so I’m guaranteed to see it at least once a day. This way I can be on the lookout for ways to begin crossing off items.</p>

<p>Bucket lists let you figure out exactly what you want to do with your life. It can provide implicit direction to your life by enabling you to figure out what is important to you. We only get one life to live and Father Time is currently undefeated. By taking charge and writing a bucket list, you can use the little time you have wisely and help you lead a rich and fulfilling life.</p>
